This repository is created to track my mastery to the pytorch.
Pytorch is a library that is extensively used for deep learning because of its flexibility and powerfullness.
But mastering it compared to the other libraries such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn is bit harder. Here I run the code related to PyTorch and take some notes on a single notebook which I will be using as a reference and cement my PyTorch Knowledge
